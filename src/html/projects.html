                    The engine behind this website. I wanted to learn more about 
                    back-end servers, and creating a way to me to update this

                    A personal database management system I wrote in order to keep track

                    A custom Telegram bot I wrote in python that allowed for custom plugins.
                    This made it super easy to add functionality to a bot, and it made
                    my group chat with friends lively. This project has now been suceeded by a
                    <a href="https://github.com/Mark-Powers/Telegram-Response-Bot-Java">rewrite</a>
                    in Java. It was difficult to manage loading and unloading in Python, and
                    wrapping the API by hand made it difficult to expand beyond basic messages.

                    I couldn't find any existing solutions that allowed me to deploy
                    these games easily, so I wrote my own. The API is not well documented,

                    A firefox extension that adds the reading length of a website to the
                    title of a page. This was my first web extension, and its technique
                    for finding paragraph content doesn't work great. It works well in
                    firefox on Ubuntu, as the window bar will display the title with
                    the updated reading time.
