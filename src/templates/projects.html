                    I use wiki.js for my personal wiki. I wanted a simple client I could use for it
                    and a command line one would also allow for me to script it. The wiki comes built
                    in with a GraphQL API, so I learned some GraphQL and created a python wrapper that
                    allows for managing and editing of wiki.js content over this API.

                    I set up a sensor on a raspberry pi zero to measure the temperature, pressure, and humidity.
                    This project is a web site that runs on the pi that plots the data over time. In the 
                    future I'd like to make the plots nicer, and include outdoor temperature data as well.

                    I had some audio files on my phone I wanted to listen to like a podcast. My podcast app is way
                    better for this type of content than a general purpose media player. So this app will locally
                    create a web server that serves an rss feed generated from a directory on your phone. This can 
                    be added like any other podcast in your favorite app.

                    A class project where I studied how to poison training datasets of source
                    code to create backdoors in a model predicting a function name based on 
                    a code body. A backdoor is an inocuous feature that will force a prediction
                    to a target label. By modifying a small proportion of training data, with 
                    something like adding an unused variable declaration, the backdoor will be 
                    successfully learned. I implemented the Sever algorithm which attempts to
                    find and remove poisoned data, but it was unsuccessful at doing so on the 
                    code2seq model architecture.

                    For class, I did a project using program synthesis to refactor programs. The program tried to

                    in the future it could really be improved by using compilers techniques. I also made
